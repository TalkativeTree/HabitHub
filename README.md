HabitHub
========

HabitHub is an open sourced habit tracking and visualization app. The goals are two fold. 

1. Provide people with an easy way to both update and be reminded to accomplish their desired habits. 
2. Provide a motiviating and informative visualization of your daily habits. 


### Why Open Sourced?

Every person wants to see their life differently (that is if anyone actually wants to contribute). The project assumes you're using Rails 4.0 and Ruby 2.1.0
